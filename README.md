# Computer Graphics (Blender)

*New York University – College of Arts and Science*

## Course Context

This repository contains my 3D modeling and animation assignments from **Computer Graphics** at NYU, **Fall 2024 semester**.
The course explored both the theoretical foundations of computer graphics and their application through industry-standard tools.
This repo includes three major Blender homework projects (HW2, HW3, HW5) and one extra credit project, each focusing on different aspects of 3D design, scene composition, and rendering.

**Tech Stack / Tools:** Blender · 3D Modeling · Lighting & Materials · Animation

## Project Highlights

* **Homework 2 — Basic 3D Scene Composition** — Creating and arranging primitive objects with accurate proportions and camera placement.
* **Homework 3 — Materials and Lighting** — Applying textures, adjusting material properties, and setting up lighting for realistic rendering.
* **Homework 5 — Animation Project** — Designing and animating a 3D scene with smooth transitions and camera movement.
* **Extra Credit — Creative 3D Project** — Extending course techniques to produce an original modeled and rendered scene.
